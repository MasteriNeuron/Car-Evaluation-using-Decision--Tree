## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to build **Decision Tree** models to classify cars based on various attributes such as:
- **Buying Price** 💸
- **Maintenance Cost** 🛠️
- **Number of Doors** 🚪
- **Passenger Capacity** 👪
- **Luggage Boot Size** 🧳
- **Safety Features** 🛡️

Key highlights:
- **Dual Approach:** Implements both a Decision Tree Classifier and a Decision Tree Regressor (with rounding) for evaluation.
- **Interpretability:** Provides visualizations and decision rules that help explain the model’s choices.
- **Model Optimization:** Employs pre-pruning and post-pruning techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Project Setup & Data Understanding**  
   - Define objectives and understand the Car Evaluation dataset from the UCI repository.
   - Explore and visualize key attributes (e.g., buying price, safety, capacity).

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encode categorical features and target variables.  
   - Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using stratification.

3. **Model Development**  
   - **Decision Tree Classifier:** Build, visualize, and evaluate the classifier.  
   - **Pruning Techniques:** Apply pre-pruning (using GridSearchCV) and post-pruning (via cost complexity) to refine the model.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - Identify the most influential attributes with feature importance scores.
   - Visualize the importance with horizontal bar charts.

5. **Alternative Approach**  
   - Implement a Decision Tree Regressor and round predictions to match classification labels.
   - Compare results with the classifier for robustness.

6. **Documentation & Reporting**  
   - Document insights, decision rules, and model performance for transparency.
